// So C++ tutorial are going parallely
// Most of the basics and theory are same 
// Can refer both work projects for same basic theory
// Only those theory comments will be added here which is particulary distinguishable from C++ projects

// Just like C++ iostream , C has stdio(standard input and output) library which needs to be included
// just like python import statements
// Here instead of cout and cin we use printf and scanf statements
