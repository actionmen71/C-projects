// so far we learnt arrays, fun, pointer, call by reference
// and we have until now passed addresses to function(call by refernce)

// now we will pass pointers and arrays to function
// It's obvious sometimes we need large variables to pass into funciton
// we can't do it manually like intx,inty,intz,inte etc.
// instead we use array as an argument and then pass it on.

// Now there are two ways to do it.
// 1 either we pass array as an argument
// 2 or we pass pointer to the array as an argument
