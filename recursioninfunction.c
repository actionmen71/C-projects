// What is recursion or recursive function?
// A function which calls itself to solve a smaller problem


// Two approaches are there to solve a problem by calling itself
// 1. Iterative approach         2. Recursive approach
// Any problem can be solved iteratively if it solved recursively
// some problems are best solved with recursion
